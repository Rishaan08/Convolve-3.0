#Convolve 3.0

Participated in Convolve 3.0 organized by IIT Guwahati. Successfully cleared the first round and qualified for the second round. Although I missed the opportunity to submit my code and analysis for the second round, I developed a basic yet effective model for predicting credit card behavior, which performed well in testing.
